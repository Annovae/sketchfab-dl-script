sketchfab-dl-script
===================

A userscript to export .obj files from Sketchfab.com  

This script allows you to export a .OBJ file from a Sketchfab model by clicking the (script-generated) 'Download .OBJ' button to the right of the 'Model Request' button on the Sketchfab model viewer page.  

Installation:  
  You must install the userscript to see the 'Download .OBJ' button on the model viewer page.  
  To do this, you must have a userscript manager installed.  
  If you have one installed, clicking on [this link](https://github.com/reinitialized/sketchfab-dl-script/raw/master/sketchfab-dl-script.user.js) should bring up a prompt to install the script.  
  I have tested the script so far on [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome) and [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox).  

Todo:  
  Add UV support
